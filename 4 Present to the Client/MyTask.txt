Here is your task
1. Prepare

A good presentation always takes a lot of preparation. The more you practice presenting your content, the more confident you will be when the time comes. Practice with your housemates, friends, family, anyone that is free! Ask for feedback and keep improving until you’re happy with your presentation and you’re confident in presenting your content.

2. Present

It is now your time to make a video recording of your presentation back to the client. It should be concise, engaging and should guide the audience on a journey with the use of storytelling to take them through the insights that you’ve uncovered and how they address the requirements. Recording the video may require a few attempts until you’re happy with the final recording, but this shouldn't take you longer than 30 minutes, since your presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes long.
